    <p>This HTML file directly loads JavaScript code from the 'src' folder.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The 'src' folder contains non-bundled and non-transpiled ES6 modules.</li>
      <li>ES-modules are files able to import or export references (variables, functions, classes...). Before ES-modules exist, splitting your codebase in multiple files was a difficult job.</li>
      <li>ES-modules are only supported by modern browsers (<a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=modules">93.68%</a> of users covered) at the time of writing.</li>
      <li>The `type="module"` attribute is used on `script` tag requiring `src/main.js`. This only works when served from a HTTP server.</li>
      <li>Please refer to this post to <a href="https://thomas-veillard.fr/front-end-web-development/languages/8-fast-tour-of-javascript-setup/">setup a local server and run the code</a></li>

<!--
  Exercice 1
  This file must be loaded from a web server in order to load the JavaScript code. 
  Otherwise, you will encounter the following errors.
  Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 0 
  Failed to load resource: Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 0
  We'll use the "npx http-server -a localhost" command to run a local server.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 2
  4 JS files were loaded.
  It takes about 5ms to load a light JS file.
  It took 60ms to load all 4 files.
  The browser downloaded all files in sequence, with an important delay between each download.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 3
  The browser looses a lot of time to download the files.
  Because the files are small and separated, the browser will encounter a lot of latency downloading each individual files.
  An efficient solution is to bundle all files into a single file.
  That would reduce the overhead to downloading one file only, and makes the parsing easier for the browser.
  Tools exists to do that automatically.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 4
  When NPM installs a package, it also installs all its dependencies in the "node_modules" folder.
  That is why there are way more packages in the "node_modules" folder than in the "package.json" file.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 5
  One module has a severe vulnerability.
  The "npm audit" command will list all vulnerabilities in the project.
  Running that command, we learn that the "chart.js" package has a vulnerability.
  This vulnerability is fixed in version 2.9.4.
  The suggested fix is outside the dependencies range.
  The terminal informs us that we can run "npm audit fix --force" to automatically fix the vulnerability.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 6
  Webpack is used to tackle the problem of slow loading time for JS files.
  It is a bundler, meaning it will bundle all JS files into a single file.
  What it does is take all the JS files and their dependencies, and create an "index.js" file containing the code of all the JS files.
  This allows the browser to download only one file, and parse it only once, reducing therefore the overhead and delay caused by the sequence download.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 7
  The "npm run build" command successfully created a "dist" folder containing the Webpack "index.js" file.
  This file contains the code of all the JS files inside eval() functions.
  Each eval() function matches the code of a JS file, on one line.
  The Webpack generated JS code is not human-readable, but will work exactly the same as the original JS files.
  In order to edit the code, we need to re-run the "npm run build" command after each change.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 8
  We open the index-bundled.html file in the browser and see that the loading time is much faster.
  Specifically, it took 4ms to load the index.js file.
  The total time including the overhead is 28ms, which is way faster than the 60ms we had previously.
-->

<!-- 
  Exercice 9
  We change the webpack.config.js file to edit the "mode" property to "production".
  Then, we re-run the "npm run build" command.
  In production mode, the Webpack generated JS code is minified, meaning it is compressed.
  It is even harder to read for a human, but it will still work exactly the same as the original JS files.
  The index.js file is only one line long.
